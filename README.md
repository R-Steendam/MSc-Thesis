All the input files and scripts used to create the data and analyze them for my thesis work titled:
"Examining the Internal Structure of Protein Aggregates using Two-Dimeansional Infrared Spectroscopy"

All MD analysis scripts have been adapted from the scripts used within the Lyzosime in water tutorial [1]

The exciton analysis script was based on previous work by T.L.C. Jansen [x]
